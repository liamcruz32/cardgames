# Goathead

## Overview
Goathead is a 3 to 4 player point-trick trick taking game in the Shafkopf family designed for a 20 card Schnapsen deck. Games in this family share common characteristics such as the point value of cards, the extended trump suit containing all Q's and/or J's, and a variable/hidden partner component.

Below, the standard 3-player game will be described. 4-player rules will be described at the bottom.

6 cards are dealt to each player with 2 in the kitty

## Points
There are two kinds of points: trick points and game points. Each trick is worth trick points according to the cards it contains. The values of the cards (in all suits) are as follows

| Card | Point Value |
|:----:|:-----------:|
|  A   |     11      |
|  10  |     10      |
|  K   |     4       |
|  Q   |     3       |
|  J   |     2       |

Added up, this is 120 pts available in the deck (30 points per suit). The goal of any round is to win at least 61 points in tricks--either alone or cumulatively with a partner.

## Bid
The bidding starts with the player to the dealer's left, and is a selection between various contracts in which a player claims they can take the majority of trick points over the course of 6 tricks. 

After a player proposes a contract, the following players must bid a higher contract or pass. If a player has fewer game points than the current bid leader, they may steal the bid for themselves by saying "I steal". You may not steal if your game points are equal to the current bid winner. The player who bids the highest contract becomes the declarer.

After the contract is declared, the declarer may choose to add the kitty to their hand. If they do, they then choose two cards to add back to the kitty. The points in the kitty count towards the declarer's trick-point total at the end of the round. After exchanging cards, the declarer may stick to their bid contract, or choose another higher ranking contract. 

## Play
In each contract, the player to the left of the dealer leads to the first trick, regardless of who made the contract. Players in turn must follow suit if able, otherwise they may play any card. There is no obligation to trump, or to lead the trick. 

The player who played the highest card in the suit led, or the highest trump if any were played, wins the trick and takes it into their scoring pile. They then lead the next trick.

## Contracts
  * **Suit**
    - The trump suit always contains the four Jacks as the highest trumps in the following order: J♣-J♠-J♥-J♦
    - The declarer calls for a suit contract by naming the suit they wish to supplement the trump suit
    - Ranking of the suit contracts follow the same order. Clubs outranking Spades, Spades outranking Hearts, then Diamonds as the lowest contract. 
      * <e.g "I'll play Hearts">
    - **Suit Ranks**
      Below is an example of a Hearts contract
      * **Trump Suit:** J♣-J♠-J♥-J♦-A♥-10♥-K♥-Q♥
      * **Fail Suits:** A-10-K-Q (♣/♠/♦)
   
  * **Nil**
    - A Nil contract ranks higher than red suit contracts (♥,♦), but lower than black suit contracts (♣,♠)
    - The Nil contract declarer commits to taking no tricks. The round is over as soon they take any trick.
    - **Suit Ranks**
      * No trump suit. Cards rank in Ace-Ten order: A-10-K-Q-J

  * **Court**
    - In a court contract, the trump suit consists of the four Jacks alone. The fail suits follow the standard Ace-10 order. Court contracts outrank all Suit and Nil contracts
      * <e.g. "I'll play Court">
    - **Suit Ranks**
        * **Trump suit:** J♣-J♠-J♥-J♦
        * **Fail Suits:** A-10-K-Q (♣/♠/♥/♦)

  * **Leasters**
    - If the bidding goes around the table without any contracts being bid, a Leasters round is player with Jacks alone as trumps. The player who takes the most points pays out to the player who took the least
    * **Trump Suit:** J♣-J♠-J♥-J♦
    * **Fail Suits:** A-10-K-9-8-7 (♣/♠/♥/♦)

## Scoring
At the end of the round, points collected in tricks are added up for each team. A contract is made if the declaring player takes at least 61 points in tricks.
Each contract has a base point value that the loser pays out to the winner. The base values are as follows:

  * Suit: 1 point
  * Nil: 2 points
  * Court: 2 points
  * Leasters: 1 point*

If the winning side takes at least 90 points, 1 point is added to the base value. If the winning side takes all tricks, 2 points are added to the base value. An additional point may be added if the player chooses not to exchange cards with the kitty.

If the declarer does not make their contract, they pay out the base points to both defending players. An additional point is paid out if the declarer fails to make 31 points.

  * *Example 1*: Declarer of a suit contract scores 66 points. Each defending player loses 1 point, the declarer gains 2
  * *Example 2*: Declarer of a court contract scores 29 points. Each defending player gains 3 points, the declarer loses 6
  * *Example 3*: Declarer of a suit contract takes all tricks and did not pick up the kitty. Each defending player loses 4 points, the declarer gains 8
  * *Leasters*: In leasters, the player who scores the most points pays the player who scores the least. The middle player gains and loses nothing.

Games are played over the course of 15 rounds, or any other agreed upon number.

## Rules for 4-player game

Deal 4 cards to each player and 4 to the kitty. Bidding follows the same conventions as a 3 player game, however suit contracts are played with the holders of the two black Jacks acting as a temporary partnership. If a player holds both black Jacks, they must announce it, and the player holding the Queen of the called suit is their partner. If a player holds both Jacks and the Queen of the called suit, they must play alone against the other three players.

Court and Nil contracts are played alone vs the other 3 players.

The declarer picks up the kitty, but does not add it to their hand. Instead they may exchange one card in their hand with the kitty. They then pass the kity to the left, and each other player in turn may exchange one card. After the other three players exchange, the dealer may choose to exchange one more card with the kitty, and play begins.
