# Goathead

## Overview
Goathead is a point-trick trick taking game in the Shafkopf family. Games in this family share common characteristics such as the point value of cards, the extended trump suit containing all Q's and J's, and a variable/hidden partner component.

## Deck and Deal
  * The deck consists of four suits of eight cards with the following point values:
    - A (11pts), 10 (10pts), K (4pts), Q (3pts), J (2pts), 9 (0pts), 8 (0pts), 7(0pts)
    - Added up, this is 120 pts available in the deck (30 points per suit)
  * Deal 8 cards to each player starting with the player to the dealer's left. Bidding will start with this player.

## Bid
The bid is a selection between various contracts in which the maker claims they can take the majority of trick points over the course of 8 tricks--most often with, but occasionally without a partner. After a player proposes a contract, the following players must bid a higher contract or pass. If a player has fewer game points than the current bid leader, they may steal the bid for themselves by saying "I steal". You may not steal if your game points are equal to the current bid winner.

## Play
In each contract, the player to the left of the dealer leads to the first trick, regardless of who made the contract. Players in turn must follow suit if able, otherwise they may play any card. There is no obligation to trump, or otherwise lead the trick. The player who played the highest card in the suit led, or the highest trump if any were played, wins the trick and takes it into their scoring pile. They then lead the next trick.

## Contracts
The following contracts are listed in order from lowest to highest:
  * **Suit**
    - The Maker calls for a suit contract by naming the suit they wish to supplement the trump suit. The holder of the Ace of that suit is the Maker's partner for that round. A player may not call for a suit in which they hold the Ace. If they hold all of the Aces, they must declare it and  play with the holder of the 7 of the called suit 
      * <e.g "I'll play Clubs">
      * <e.g "I'll play Diamonds with 7">
    - *Suit Ranks*
    In addition to the suit called, all Queens and Jacks are part of the trump suit. Below is an example of a Hearts contract
      * *Trump Suit:* Q♣-Q♠-Q♥-Q♦-J♣-J♠-J♥-J♦-A♥-10♥-K♥-Q♥-9♥-8♥-7♥
    * NOTE: In every contract, the order of suits remains the same at the top: Clubs, Spades, Hearts, Diamonds. A pneumonic to remember this is "Black above red; round above sharp"

  * **Nil**
    - The Maker of a Nil contract plays alone and aims to take zero tricks.
      * <e.g. "I'll play Nil">
    - *Suit Ranks*
      * No Trumps. Cards rank A-10-K-Q-J-9-8-7

  * **Court**
    - There are three possible court contracts: Kings, Queens, Jacks. The maker of a court game plays alone against the other three players. For the purposes of bidding, Jacks outrank Queens, Queens outrank Kings
      * <e.g. "I'll play Queens">
    - Suit Ranks
      - Trump suit consists entirely of the card named in bidding.
        * Trump suit in a Queens contract: Q♣-Q♠-Q♥-Q♦
        * Fail Suits: A-10-K-J-9-8-7 (♣/♠/♥/♦)

  * **Alone**
    - Playing an "Alone" contract is the same as playing a Suit contract but the called suit Ace does not play as the Maker's partner. The Maker is not required to bid a suit in which they do not hold an Ace like in the standard Suit contract.
      * <e.g. "I'll play alone with Spades">
    - Suit Ranks:
      * *Trump Suit:* Q♣-Q♠-Q♥-Q♦-J♣-J♠-J♥-J♦-A♠-10♠-K♠-Q♠-9♠-8♠-7♠
      * *Fail Suit:* A-10-K-9-8-7 (♣/♥/♦)

  * **Slams**
    - A non Nil contract (Suit, Court, or Alone) may be bid as a slam, where the Maker (or team) aims to take every trick. A Suit Slam outranks Alone, Court Slam outranks Suit Slam, and an Alone Slam outranks every other contract.
      * <e.g. "I'll play Queens and slam">

  * **Junkyard**
    - If the bidding goes around the table without any contracts being bid, the round is Junk and is played with Queens and Jacks as Trump and each player partnered with the person sitting across from them. Whichever team takes the least amount of points in tricks wins the game
    * *Trump Suit:* Q♣-Q♠-Q♥-Q♦-J♣-J♠-J♥-J♦
  * *Fail Suits:* A-10-K-9-8-7 (♣/♠/♥/♦)

## Scoring
During the play of the round, the players opposing the maker aims to take at least 31 points in tricks (alternatively, the declaring team aims to make at least 90 points to gain a bonus). This is known as "making brush". Failure to make brush results in the declaring team scoring extra points.

For Solo contracts, the three players opposing the maker collectively add their trick points. The following table outlines the game points awarded for each contract (note that slam bonuses are not applied unless the contract was bid as a slam)
