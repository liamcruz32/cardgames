## Deck and Deal
The deck consists of 32-cards. Deal 10 cards to each player plus 2 cards face down in the Kitty

## Card Ranks
Cards rank from A high to 7 low normally. The trump suit instead has the Jack as the highest card, and the other Jack of the same suit color as the second highest trump card.

Example for a round with clubs as trump:
  * **♣ (trump):** J♣-J♠-A♣-K♣-Q♣-10♣-9♣-8♣-7♣
  * **♥/♦:** A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7
  * **♠:** A-K-Q-10-9-8-7

## The Bid
Bidding begins with the player to the dealer's left. A player bids to win at least a number of tricks with a trump suit of their choice. A suit must be named with the bid, but there is no ranking among suits except that bids of No Trump are out ranked by a suited bid. (A bid of 5NT can be beat by a bid of 5♠, but to beat 5♠, a bid must be at least 6)

A player may also bid Misere, which is a commitment to take no tricks with no trump. Misere bids rank higher than 6, but less than 7NT. Misere cannot be bid unless the bid is already at 6.

Unless the bid is Misere, the winner of the bid takes the two cards from the Kitty and adds them to their hand. They must then bury two cards by placing them face down again off to the side. Misere bids do not get to trade cards with the kitty.

Bidding goes until 2 players pass in a row. A player may pass and then rebid later in the round. If every player passes in the first round of bidding, the hand is thrown in and the same next person deals. The next round is played with doubled stakes.

## Play
Players must follow suit if able, otherwise may play any card. In No Trump bids, the Joker remains as the sole trump card and therefore must be played either as a lead or when the owner cannot follow suit.


## Scoring
If a player makes their bid they make 1 point per trick bid. Additionally a bid of at least 7 will grant a 5 point bonus, and bidding 9 or 10 will grant a bonus of 15 points (making the maximum score in a round 25). Tricks over the amount bid do not score points.

If a player does not make his bid, they lose the amount of points they would have made if their bid was successful. Their opponents each score 1 point for the total tricks they won together.

A game is played to 50 points or any other agreed upon number.
