# Gamut

## Hook
Gamut is a 4 person trick-play game where the rules and goals each round is determined by the suit of the final card dealt.

## The Deal
  * Four players each receive 8 cards from a 32-card pack containing A K Q J T 9 8 7 in each suit. The ranking of the cards is dependent on the suit of the final card dealt; dealt face up. The turn to deal and play passes always to the left.
